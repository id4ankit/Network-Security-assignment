Introduction
This repository contains the implementation of various encryption, decryption, and cracking techniques for both classical cryptography and modern cryptographic techniques and protocols (MTP). It serves as an educational tool to understand the principles behind these cryptographic methods.

Classical Cryptography
Classical cryptography refers to cryptographic techniques that were used before the modern era of computing. These methods are often simpler and include famous algorithms such as Caesar Cipher, Vigenère Cipher, and others.

Encryption
The encryption process for classical cryptography involves converting plaintext into ciphertext using a specific algorithm and a key.

Decryption
Decryption is the reverse process of encryption, where ciphertext is converted back into plaintext using the same algorithm and key.

Cracking
Cracking involves breaking the encryption without knowing the key. This can be done through various methods such as frequency analysis, brute force attacks, and more.

Modern Cryptographic Techniques and Protocols (MTP)
Modern cryptographic techniques and protocols involve more complex algorithms designed to provide higher levels of security. These include algorithms like AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman), and more.

MTP Encryption
Encryption using modern cryptographic techniques involves converting plaintext into ciphertext using advanced algorithms and keys. These methods are designed to be secure against modern computational attacks.

MTP Decryption
Decryption in MTP involves converting the ciphertext back into plaintext using the appropriate algorithm and key.

MTP Cracking
Cracking modern cryptographic algorithms is significantly more challenging due to the complexity and robustness of these algorithms. Techniques may involve sophisticated methods such as side-channel attacks, cryptanalysis, and more.
