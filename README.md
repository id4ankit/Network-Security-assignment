Introduction <br>
This repository contains the implementation of various encryption, decryption, and cracking techniques for both classical cryptography and modern cryptographic techniques and protocols (MTP). 

Classical Cryptography  <br>
Classical cryptography refers to cryptographic techniques that were used before the modern era of computing.

Encryption  <br>
The encryption process for classical cryptography involves converting plaintext into ciphertext using a specific algorithm and a key.

Decryption  <br>
Decryption is the reverse process of encryption, where ciphertext is converted back into plaintext using the same algorithm and key.

Cracking  <br>
Cracking involves breaking the encryption without knowing the key. This can be done through various methods such as frequency analysis, brute force attacks, and more.

Modern Cryptographic Techniques and Protocols (MTP)  <br>
Modern cryptographic techniques and protocols involve more complex algorithms designed to provide higher levels of security. These include algorithms like AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman), and more.

MTP Encryption  <br>
Encryption using modern cryptographic techniques involves converting plaintext into ciphertext using advanced algorithms and keys. T

MTP Decryption  <br>
Decryption in MTP involves converting the ciphertext back into plaintext using the appropriate algorithm and key.

MTP Cracking  <br>
Cracking modern cryptographic algorithms is significantly more challenging due to the complexity and robustness of these algorithms.
